## Clockcycles Benchmarker GCC
Benchmarking C code by analyzing clock cycles count in execution using GCC complier. Starter code was taken from a lab in https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2023/spring/cmpt/295/d100

## Notes
- Created for Linux GCC version.
- The clock cycles measured vary depending on the hardware used.
- This repository is intended to serve as a guide for benchmarking C code using GCC, and the results obtained will not show performance of your specific system or program.
- The benchmarking code in this repository is simple and can be modified to suit your specific needs.
